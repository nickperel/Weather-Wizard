  ## Description
  
  * This week, I was given no starter code and was tasked with creating an app that would allow the user to view the weather outlook for multiple cities. When the user searches for a city, they will be presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city will be added to the search history. When the user views the current weather conditions for that city, they will see the city name, the date, an icon which represents the current weather condition, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the user views the future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a five day forecast which displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions for those 5 days, the temperature, the wind speed, and humidity. The user also has the ability to navigate through the cities that are listed in their search history by just clicking on the city name and then the stats for that city will then be displayed again on the screen.
